# Catchy-Got-U
Arduino sensing proximity and capture picture

This project is based on the android camera and motion sensor on arduino connected through IBM Bluemix platform. The motion sensor activates the camera whenever motion is sensed.

The reason behind the name of the app and the app itself..
There was this squirell which almost dig a pach of hole on my living room wall i believe 3 years ago when we had below 20 degree farhaniet wind shield. This squirell was climbing the wall on the back of the house by the deck creating a whole just behind the motion sensor light mounted on the wall. Due to the warmth of the insulation between the internal the external wall started to live in there until one day me and my daughter age 9 that time heard the squirell making noise. We hit the wall, guess what, a squirell jump out of the wall on to the deck and run away. He didn't end up with that. He did tried few times when we're not home. My daughter gave him a name Scraffy. I should have called the app Scraffy, but preffered Catchy/Got-U. I was wishing to have some kind of scaring mechanism to make him run away.
